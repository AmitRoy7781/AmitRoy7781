# Hi 👋!

🌱 I am Amit Roy.

👨‍🎓 I am a PhD student at [Purdue Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) from the Fall 2022 to Present.

🧐 My research focus includes how capable LLMs are over different reasoning tasks and how scaling/post-training approaches impact the reasoning capabilities.

💻 I worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Fintech during the summer of 2025.

🎓 In May 2025, I obtained an MS degree from Purdue Computer Science.

📚 In August 2020, I completed my undergrad at the Department of CSE, University of Dhaka (**Class Rank 1<sup>st</sup>**).
