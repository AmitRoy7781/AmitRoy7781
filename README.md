# Hi 👋! 
🌱 I am Amit Roy. 

I am a graduate student at [Purdue Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/). 

🧐 My research interests lie in deep learning for real-life applications involving GNN and LLM.

Fortunately, I got the opportunity to work with [Prof. Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue/home) on a Sony-funded project on the Graph Anomaly Detection problem.

🌟 Please feel free to contact me through email [📧](mailto:roy206@purdue.edu). Further information is listed on my [portfolio](https://amitroy7781.github.io/).
