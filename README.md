# Hi 👋! 
🌱 I am Amit Roy, living in Lafayette, Indiana, USA from Bangladesh. 

👨‍🎓 I am a graduate student at [Purdue Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) from the Fall of 2022 to Present. 

🧐 My research interests lie in deep learning for real-life applications involving GNN and LLM.

⭐ Until 2023, I worked with [Prof. Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue/home) on the Graph Anomaly Detection problem funded by Sony, Belgium.
