# Hi 👋! 
🌱 I am Amit Roy. 

I am a graduate student at [Purdue Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) and fortunate to get an opportunity to work with [Prof. Pan Li](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/panli.html).

🧐 My research interests lie in deep learning for real-life applications and recently published works on Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) problem.
